<h1 align="center">DnD Player Sheet</h1>

The ideal game of Dungeons and Dragons should be smooth in gameplay and storytelling so why do we limit ourselves with paper and a pencil? With the limited space available for all of the stat and inventory changes, notes, and player background information, it just seems more fitting to give players the ability to utilize a digital player sheets. With my DnD player sheet, now you won't run the risk of losing your document either.

<h2 align="left">How It's Made:</h2>

**Tech used:** React, MaterialUI, Redux Toolkit, React Router, Node.js, MongoDB

This is the first project that truly challenged my understanding of React. Previously I could make simple landing pages and one page apps but this project made me think outside of the box from what I normally knew and allowed me to learn how to route to specific pages using React Router. 

I chose MaterialUI to style the application to have a familiar, uniform look. This was my first time using styled components and it was odd at first but in the long run it gave me functionality I found incredibly valuable and it saved me the time and effort of implementing it myself. 

Previously in my applications I created in the past I used Redux but this time I chose to use Redux Toolkit. I have to say Redux Toolkit gives the user all of the funcitonality of Redux but makes everything simpler. The learning curve has been lowered and it allows us to use mutible methods that developers are more experienced and used to using. Redux Toolkit reduces the amount of boiler plate code needed and the file management is much cleaner. I will not be going back to vanilla Redux as it brings zero positives over Redux Toolkit for me.

For my backend I stuck to my familiarity with Node.js for the server building and MongoDB as my database.
